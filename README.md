## Your task
You can find a detailed task description in the SearchController.php. The rest of this application is just a default Laravel installation without any changes. You can implement your task in the SearchController only, or add additional files as you see fit.

Please note that we do not expect you to write this code in the same way you would write the code for a "big" application.
We do not award points for applying various patterns like repositories, Request/Response classes, services, or even Models.
Please focus on correctly implementing the business logic that is described in the SearchController. It is fine if you only add code in the SearchController. You can add models and other files if you want, but we do not expect you to.  

## Infos
You can run the project with your local php installation: `php artisan serve`. You should then get a dummy response when opening `http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/search` in your browser.

There is no mysql database available in this dummy project. You do not need to set one up. Feel free though to recreate the DB structure in your db client in order to test your queries.
